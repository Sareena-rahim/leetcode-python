## 👋 About Me
Hi! I'm Sareena Rahim, a career changer who recently discovered my passion for programming and decided to take the leap into the tech world.
I'm currently learning Python as a complete beginner, and what excites me most about programming is the incredible feeling of solving a problem after struggling with it. I love how there's always something new to learn — whether it's finding a better way to write code, understanding a new concept, or realizing how one small change can make a big difference.
My goals:

- Land a job as a Python developer
- Build my own meaningful projects
- Create real-world solutions with code
